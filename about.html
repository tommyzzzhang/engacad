            <h3>Self-introduction</h3>
            <p>I am an outgoing person, i like to interact with others so i can learn their good traits.
                One of my life goals is to make huge amount of money and bring my family to travel around the whole world. 
                I am also a keen learner that like to explore those things that i do not know, 
                this has allowed me to acquire tons of knowledge through my learning journal.
            </p>
            <p>I have many different kind of hobbies: playing basketball, listening to music, travelling, eating delicious food ... ! 
                What i enjoy the most would definitely be playing basketball. I had a dream to become an NBA player when i was young. 
                But now, i want to make basketball as one of my careers.
                 Besides this, i also like to travel and try different kind of delicacies from countries all aroung the world.
            </p>
            <p>The reason why i join this DigFab Program is because i am interested in enriching myself. 
                I want to learn new things that are challenging and interesting. Joinging this program can also allow me to meet new friends
                and therefore i am able to have fun and learn things from my friends at the same time.
                After attending the lessons, i am sure that i made the right choice to join the program and i have already learn myriad of new things
                at the first two days. If i have the chance, i will definitely encourage my friends to join this fulfilling and meaningful program.
                </p>
